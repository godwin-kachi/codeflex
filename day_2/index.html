<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Day 2 of my codeflex coding challenge!</h1>
    <p>This challenge is to help me understand other html elements I did not cover in my Day 1</p>
    <p>First is an address tag used below</p>
    <address>
        202, Brigadier Ademulegun Road,<br>
        Ondo, <br>Ondo State. <br>10-11-2024
    </address>
    <p>Another cool element I can also use is the datalist element that defines a list of autocomplete options when using a text <code>input</code> as demonstrated below </p>

    <p><code>div</code> is an element in html that is used to group other elements together. It is however a block element! I will use a div to group the next elements</p>

    <div>
        <label for="countries">African Countries</label>
        <input list="countries" id="countries" placeholder="Type a country name">

        <datalist id="countries">
            <option value="Nigeria">Nigeria</option>
            <option value="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</option>
            <option value="Egypt">Egypt</option>
            <option value="Seychelles">Seychelles</option>
        </datalist>

    </div>

    <p>An <code>img</code> tag enables developers to insert images to their app
    an <code>img</code> tag can grab an image locally from our file system or choose an image from an online repository and render it in our page as shown below</p>
    <img src="https://placehold.co/600x400" alt="A dummy image from placehold.co">
    <span>A span tag is used to define a generic inline container of content, that does not carry any semantic value. And becaise it is an inline element, it will share a line with the <code>img</code> tag since it is also an inline element</span>

    <h3>All documentation are called from <a href="https://htmlreference.io">HTML REFERENCE Official website</a>
    </h3>

    <h2>This is the last line I added and it was added because I used the w3c validator which pointed me to include countries as ID for element that references the label for attribute!</h2>
